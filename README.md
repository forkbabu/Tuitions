# Tuitions
ML private tuitions by Teacher: [Sayantan Das](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ucalyptus/).
An affordable no-nonsense initiative started to help students who are new to this field and professionals who want to change their careers.
Course is designed to be math-intensive.Participants will be involving themselves with the basics in math before any state of the art ML project can be tutored.
Every class will be around 2 hours with theoretical explanation and programmatic session given equal weightage. Doubt clearing sessions will be separate.
Students will get the chance to sit back and study before doubt clearing sessions are held for every corresponding class session.

# Curriculum (84 hours)
The course is a bit different.In addition to clearing the foundations of the participant,the instructor wishes to fast-track each of his students into becoming
early researchers of Machine Learning engineers. These steps will definitely involve learning to take part in online data science contests,be able to solve internship assignment tasks with confidence and write code as a part of ML OSS community or any of your favorite Open Source ML tools.While most courses online are based on a set syllabus that is taken by around 10k to 10L people, most of them do not give you an edge in your career as long as innovative projects are not made by the person.This course aims to bring the Do-it-yourself temperament into the participant.
